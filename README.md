# Invasive Species Distribution Modelling
The aim of this project was to analyse the effectiveness of various techniques and approaches for modelling the distribution of birds, including the impact of environmental features such as fertilisers and pesticides. This data was taken from the National Biodiversity Network and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. We found that fertiliser and pesticide features do not significantly contribute to the predictive power of the models and can even cause overfitting. We used various machine learning techniques and algorithms to optimize the performance of the models, achieving exceptional performance and relatively consistent and accurate results for predicting individual species. We also used machine learning to predict new observations by using false positive cells as potential predictions and comparing them to ground truth observations. The model performed best on 10km raster cells and did not require oversampling methods to improve its general performance.\

Species distribution modelling is a field of study that aims to predict the geographic distribution of species based on environmental and habitat factors. It is a powerful tool for understanding how species are distributed across the landscape. There are many different approaches to species distribution modelling, ranging from simple statistical models to more complex machine learning algorithms. The choice of modelling approach depends on the availability of data, the complexity of the species distribution patterns, and the goals of the analysis. In this project, we will explore the use of species distribution modelling to predict the distribution of a particular species based on environmental and habitat factors. This data will be gather from multiple sources such as the National Biodiversity Network and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. We will develop a predictive model, validate it using independent data, and use it to map potential new distributions of species.\
